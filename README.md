# Pokemon Challenge

Ash is catching Pokémon in an infinte 2D map. There is a Pokémon in each square of the map.

Ash starts in a square and catches the first Pokémon. He then moves to a square North, South, East or West from the current square and catches the Pokémon there. If he returns to a square he's visited before, there will not be a Pokémon there anymore. 

Given an input with the sequence of movements, how many Pokémon does Ash catch?
